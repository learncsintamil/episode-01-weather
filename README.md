## Weather App

A sample weather finding application using node.js for learning and understanding the technologies involved.

## Steps To Run

Make sure you have the latest version of node.js installed on your machine. I've developed it using `15.0.1`.

1. Install the packages using the `npm install` command.
2. Then start the server in the `dev` mode using the `npm run dev` command.
3. Visit http://localhost:3000 in the browser to view the app.
